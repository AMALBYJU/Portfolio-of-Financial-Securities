# Portfolio of Financial Securities

## Project Description: ##

`Prices.csv` (source: Yahoo Finance) contains close price data from 12/31/1999 through 12/31/2018 for:
* 6 equity instruments: AAPL, AMZN, ATT, GE, Intel (INTC) and SPY
* 1 fixed income instrument: BOND
* 2 commodity instruments: Gold and Silver
* 2 currency pairs: EUR-USD and AUD-USD

We choose
* Any 5 equity instruments
* 1 fixed income instrument (we only have one â€“ BOND)
* 1 of the 2 commodity instruments
* 1 of the 2 currency pairs

The objective is to construct a portfolio of the chosen 8 instruments in such a way so as to get a good Sharpe. We can use Moving Average Crossover or Bollinger Band strategy in combination with this to improve its performance.
